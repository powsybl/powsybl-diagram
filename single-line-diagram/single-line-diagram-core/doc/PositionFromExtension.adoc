= `PositionFromExtension`: Position from an explicit configuration

The `PositionFromExtension` takes the information from the `iidm` extension.
It is gathered:

* in `NetworkGraphBuilder.visitBusbarSection()` when building the graph for the `BusNode` positions
* and completed in `PositionFromExtension.gatherLayoutExtensionInformation()` for the feeders' order, in which the `BusCell.getOrder()` is called to determine the order of the cell.
