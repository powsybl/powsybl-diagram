= `BSCluster`

`BSCluster` (`BusNode` Sets Cluster) are used by implementations of `PositionFinder`.

****
It is composed of 2 kinds of sets of `BusNode` Sets that present an horizontal and a vertical view of the structure of a `VoltageLevel`:

- `List<VerticalBusSet> verticalBusSets` see link:VerticalBusSet.adoc[VerticalBusSet]
- `List<HorizontalBusList> horizontalBusLists` see link:HorizontalBusList.adoc[HorizontalBusList]
****

A `BSCluster` is initiated with one `VerticalBusSet` that:

- is put as is as first element `verticalBusSets`. Important reminder: a `VerticalBusSet` design is driven by legs of `BusCells`.
- inititiate one `HorizontalBusList` for each of its `BusNode`

Each `PositionFinder` using `BSCluster` implementation provides a strategy to merge them together in order to get a single `BSCluster`.
