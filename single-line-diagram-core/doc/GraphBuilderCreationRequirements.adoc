== GraphBuilder creation requirements

Implementing a GraphBuilder is the way to build the graph to be rendered by SingleLineDiagram.
This shall implement builder for `VoltageLevelGraph`, `SubstationGraph` and `ZoneGraph`.
Here are some hints that are to be considered.

=== VoltageLevelGraph
A `VoltageLevelGraph` is made of nodes that extend the `model.nodes.Node` class.
The `Node` holds an `NodeType` enum that can take the following values:

* `BUS`: representing the BusBar, rendered as one straight horizontal line. The `BusNode` class extending `Node` is initialized with this value
* `FEEDER`: representing what connect the VoltageLevel to the outside, rendered on top or bottom of the voltageLevel.  The `FeederNode` class extending  `Node` is initialized with this value
* `INTERNAL` and `SWITCH`: representing nodes that constitute the graph connecting the Buses and the Feeders. (Note that only the `SwitchNode` class should be initialized with `SWITCH`.)

The graph shall be built:

* using `graph.NodeFactory` class for creating nodes. There are factories for each kind of nodes.
If new nodes are needed ensure to add the created node to the graph appropriately.
* connecting them with `VoltageLevelGraph.addEdge`

==== Components
Each node has a `componentTypeName` that is related to a `ComponentLibrary`.

* an easy way to add nodes with components that are not in the NodeFactory is to create a Node with `NodeFactory.createNode`. See `test.raw.TestAddExternalComponent`.
* Nodes that are to be drawn connected to a BusBar shall have this ability.
No need to care about that rule as an adapted node (a `Node` with `BUS_CONNECTION` component) will be inserted between the bus and the node if the node is not directly connected to the bus.
Note that:

** This ability is given to some components in `layout.LayoutParameters.componentsOnBusbars`.
By default this is set with `DISCONNECTOR` (`BUS_CONNECTION` is implicit as it is needed for the algorithm to work).
** The `BUS_CONNECTION` component is the one that will be inserted if the component that is connected to the bus has not this ability.
Therefore, ensure the `ComponentLibrary` contains the `BUS_CONNECTION` component.
