## PowSyBl framework

PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework written in Java, that makes it easy to write complex
software for power systemsâ€™ simulations and analysis. Its modular approach allows developers to extend or customize its
features.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects
within the energy and electricity sectors.

## PowSyBl Network Area Diagram

PowSyBl Network Area Diagram is a component built on top of the `Network` model available in the PowSyBl Core repository responsible for generating a concise diagram of the whole network or of a part of the network, showing in particular the interconnections between the different voltage levels.
A network area diagram emphasizes the electrical structure of the network, and may differ substantially from the network physical geography.
It displays a graph whose nodes are the network voltage levels, and whose edges are the lines and transformers between those voltage levels.


## PowSyBl Single Line Diagram

PowSyBl Single Line Diagram is a component built on top of the `Network` model available in the PowSyBl Core repository responsible 
for generating a [single line diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-line_diagram).

The main features are:
 - Node/Breaker and Bus/Breaker topology.
 - [SVG](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) diagram to be used in various front-end technologies.
 - Voltage level, substation and zone diagrams.
 - Highly customizable rendering using equipment component libraries, CSS and configurable labels (position and content).
 - Multiple layout modes: fully automatic, semi-automatic (using relative positions for busbar sections and feeders), CGMES DL.
