     * - fill the <code>fixedPoints</code> and <code>movingPoints</code> Map of <code>layoutContext</code> depending on if the vertex are in <code>fixedNodes</code> or not<br>
     * - use <code>initialPoints</code> to give a starting position to all the points, or create a position if no initial position is given<br>
     * Regarding the initial position, take care that the created positions do not overlap too much. Some forces such as repulsion forces will not work if points are at the exact same place<br>
     * It is therefore ill-advised to put all the points on (0, 0) for example.
     * For a simple example, see {@link SquareRandomSetup}
